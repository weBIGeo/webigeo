# weBIGeo
WeBIGeo is a research project focused on real-time 3D computer graphics, large data visualization, and human-computer interaction. The goal is to offer a platform that is easy to use and allows for fast analysis and visualization of geographical datasets. (Further information can be found [here](https://www.netidee.at/webigeo).)

To that end, WeBIGeo uses existing technologies from the [AlpineMaps.org Project](https://alpinemapsorg.github.io/renderer/) and introduces a new WebGPU rendering engine.
